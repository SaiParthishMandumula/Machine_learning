Que is For which depths does the result indicate overfitting?
     Answer :- By examining the data, we can determine that overfitting occurs as the depth rises.When testing accuracy is low while training accuracy is high, overfitting develops.The result shows that overfitting is occurring at depth = 5 since we receive an excessively high training accuracy of 0.98 but testing accuracy is just 0.57.By examining the data, we can determine that overfitting occurs as the depth rises .When testing accuracy is low while training accuracy is high, overfitting develops.The result shows that overfitting is occurring at depth = 5 since we receive an excessively high training accuracy of 0.98 but testing accuracy is just 0.57.
